## Future Goals
In the long term, this project aims to go beyond aggregating data links. We plan to:
- Extract public data from PDFs and other formats that are not easily analyzable.
- Convert these datasets into modern, analysis-friendly formats like Parquet and JSON.
  
This will help make Moroccan open data more accessible and ready for analysis by data analysts and data scientists.
